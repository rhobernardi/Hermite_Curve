# Hermite Curve


- DEFINITION: 

The Hermite Curve is a precision curve, made by changes of speed vectors of the two extreme points in a line.
In this program, the line is generated by pressing the mouse left button and releasing this somewhere in the screen viewport. Is possible to see 4 dots in the line and lines blue and green. The green ones are the speed vectors and the blue is the line itself. 
Now, pressing the keyboard keys "W A S D", the speed vector from P0 will be changed following the keymap:


	W = increase speed, A = counter clockwise rotation, S = decrease speed, D = clockwise rotation


Same way for the speed vector from P1 will be changed by pressing the keys "I J K L", following the keymap:


	I = increase speed, J = counter clockwise rotation, K = decrease speed, L = clockwise rotation



- COMPILATION

To compile the code, open a terminal, go to the folder and type the command:
	
	$ g++ HermiteCurve.cpp -lglut -lGL -lGLEW -lGLU -o HermiteCurve

**NOTE: make shure OpenGL 5.4 is configured correctly and all the libs used in the flags used in compilation are installed


Now, just have to run the program and follow the instructions above:

	$ ./HermiteCurve
	
There is a Makefile included that makes it easier, just go to the folder and type the command:

	$ make
