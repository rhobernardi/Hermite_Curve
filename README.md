# Hermite Curve


- DEFINITION: 

The Hermite Curve is a precision curve, made by changes of speed vectors of the two extreme points in a line.
In this program, the line is generated by pressing the mouse left button somewhere creating a point and pressing the button again creating another point and generating the line in the screen viewport. Is possible to see 4 dots and lines blue and green. The green ones are the speed vectors and the blue is the line itself.
Now is possible to click in one speed vector and drop it to change its values. The line will be recalculated and regenerated with the updated values.
Obs: The second speed vector is inverted. So the curve is going in the "wrong way", but is just because of this invertion.
ESC closes the program.

- COMPILATION

To compile the code, open a terminal, go to the folder and type the command:
	
	$ g++ HermiteCurve.cpp -lglut -lGL -lGLEW -lGLU -o HermiteCurve

**NOTE: make shure OpenGL 5.4 is configured correctly and all the libs used in the flags used in compilation are installed


Now, just have to run the program and follow the instructions above:

	$ ./HermiteCurve
	
There is a Makefile included that makes it easier, just go to the folder and type the command:

	$ make
